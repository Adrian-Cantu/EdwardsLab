#Community Assembly

## General codes for community assembly approaches

These were written by Rob to explore the role of community assembly, and were inspired by work by Sloan, Curtiss, Quince, and Head, as well as Jim Nulton at SDSU.

# Neutral approach

I am only using the neutral approach to identify those organisms that are *not* neutral in their assemblage. I do not want to parameterize the model, although you might argue that I need to do that to accurately identify those organisms that do not have a neutral assembly. I care more about which organisms are different from the baseline and what are not.

We are going to start with a simple model of bags:

|---|---|---|
| Bag 1 | Bag 2 | Bag 3 |
|---|---|---|
| red | red | red |
| red | red | blue |
| red | blue | blue |
| red | blue | blue |
| red | green | blue |
|---|---|---|





In bag 1, there are 5/5 red balls; in bag 2 there are 2/5 red, 2/5 blue, and 1/5 green; in bag 3 there are 1/5 red and 4/5 blue. The average of these numbers (8/15 red; 6/15 blue; and 1/15 green) become the x values in the graph.

The red balls are in all 3 bags (3/3), the blue balls in 2/3 bags, and the green balls in 1/3 bags. These numbers become the y-axis on the graph.
